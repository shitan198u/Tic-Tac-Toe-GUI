Using Pip:

You can also install PyQt5 using the `pip` package manager. Here's how:

1. First, make sure you have `pip` installed on your system. You can check if `pip` is installed by running the command `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`. If `pip` is not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian you can run `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`.

2. Once you have `pip` installed, you can install PyQt5 by running the command `pip install PyQt5` or `pip3 install PyQt5`. This will download and install the latest version of PyQt5 from the Python Package Index.

After installing PyQt5 using `pip`, you should be able to run the PyQt5 GUI application script.
